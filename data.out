Cats that roam outside will get fleas at some time.
 Cat fleas will not live on people, but fleas will not hesitate to bite anyone nearby.
 Owners may choose to buy anti-flea collars, but any areas where the cat normally sleeps need to be cleaned up.
 A vet or local pet-shop may offer advice about fleas.
 It is recommended that people quickly take action when a cat gets fleas because fleas can make cats uncomfortable.
House cats can become overweight through lack of exercise and over-feeding.
 When they get spayed or neutered ("fixed"), they tend to exercise less.
 Spaying is done for queens, and neutering is done for toms.
 It is important to fix cats, and here are some reasons.
 First of all, if a female cat has kittens, they will need homes.
 Finding homes for kittens is often quite difficult.
 If a tom is not fixed, it develops a disgusting smell.
 Breeders who have entire toms keep them in a special hut outside the house, for that reason.
 Fixing also helps to avoid over-population.
 Over-population means that there are too many cats, and some will be put to sleep (put down) in animal pounds (animal shelters).
